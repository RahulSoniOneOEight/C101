# Mercur Marketplace Project

**This is a Mercur marketplace project — an open-source AI-native multi-vendor marketplace built on MedusaJS v2.**

## Read the docs first

Before any non-trivial change, read the **bundled documentation** — it ships as a dependency, so it is offline and version-matched to this project's packages:

1. Index: `node_modules/@mercurjs/docs/llms.txt`
2. Full pages: `node_modules/@mercurjs/docs/content/**/*.mdx`

It covers the domain model (sellers, products, offers, attributes, commissions, payouts, order groups), the CLI, the typed API client, the dashboard SDK, and module references. Don't guess at an API or data model the docs already describe.

### Project Structure

```
├── packages/api/         # Backend API — modules, workflows, links, subscribers
├── apps/admin/           # Admin dashboard — operator panel
├── apps/vendor/          # Vendor portal — seller dashboard
└── blocks.json           # Block configuration and registry aliases
```

## Documentation

- **Bundled docs (read first)**: `node_modules/@mercurjs/docs/llms.txt` → `content/**/*.mdx`
- **Online docs**: https://docs.mercurjs.com
- **MCP Server**: https://docs.mercurjs.com/mcp — connect your AI agent for documentation search
- **llms.txt (online)**: https://docs.mercurjs.com/llms.txt

## Configuration Files

- `blocks.json` — block configuration and registry path aliases
- `packages/api/medusa-config.ts` — MedusaJS configuration
- `apps/admin/vite.config.ts` — admin dashboard build config
- `apps/vendor/vite.config.ts` — vendor portal build config

## Getting Started

```bash
bun run dev
```

This starts:

- Backend API at `http://localhost:9000`
- Admin Panel at `http://localhost:9000/seller`
- Vendor Panel at `http://localhost:9000/dashboard`

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
